Mathilda brings back control of your tweets.

== Description ==

Mathilda is trying to give you back control of your tweets. The plugin takes your tweets from twitter and saves them into the WordPress database. The tweets can be displayed on the blog chronologically (but do not have to). Indeed, Twitter is also blogging, micro-blogging so to speak. 

= Functions =

* Copy your tweets back
* Copy your tweeted images back
* Display your tweets on the blog
* Import your complete tweet history
* Export your tweets as CSV file
* Plugin Healthy Check
* Languague: English, German (only FrontEnd)

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Follow the configuration manual [See other Notes](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/mathilda/other_notes/)

Of course the installation through wordpress plugin menu is more convienient as the procedure above.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which Tweets are displayed in the blog? =

Mathilda focuses on the core functionality of Twitter meaning only Text-Tweets, Images, Hashtags, Mentions and Links are displayed. Image Series, Surveys, Quotes, Videos and GEO-Locations are not supported. 

= Why does Mathilda not support Retweets? =

Retweets are not your data. That is why we do not show them.

= Will the tweets be loaded automaticly? =

Yes. But the first load must be done manually with the cron (Tools/Tweets). Otherwise the autoload will not activated.

= How often will the tweets be loaded? =

As Standard your tweets will be fetched from Twitter every 15 minutes. But you can define the period different in the plugin settings.

= What is the difference between Cron and Import? =

The cron takes your tweets online through the Twitter API and saves them into the WordPress Database regularly. The Import takes your tweets from the files of your Twitter Archieve and saves them into the WordPress Database. For this, you must download your archieve from Twitter before.

= What do I have to do first, run the cron or import my tweets? =

All the same. It works both. Mathilda is flexible. But the autoload will only be activated with an initial cron.

= How can I import my tweet history? =

Twitter API provides access to your 3200 latest tweets. If you have not written more, the import is not required. To import your tweets, you must download your tweet archive from Twitter (Profile/Settings/Your Twitter Data). Your archive contains the folder "data/js/tweets". Upload the containing files to "www.yourblog.com/wp-content/uploads/mathilda-import/". Now you can run the import (Tools/Tweets).
