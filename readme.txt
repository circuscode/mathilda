Mathilda takes your tweets from Twitter continuously, saves them in the WordPress database and displays them on the blog.

== Description ==

Mathilda is trying to give you back some control of your tweets. The plugin takes your tweets from twitter continuously and saves them into the WordPress database. The tweets can be displayed on the blog chronologically (but do not have to). Indeed, Twitter is also blogging, micro-blogging so to speak. 

= Functions =

* Copy your tweeted images back
* Display your tweets on the blog
* Shows basic tweet statistics
* Import your complete tweet history
* Export your tweets as CSV file
* Plugin Healthy Check
* Languague: English, German (only FrontEnd)

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder to /wp-content/plugins/ or download plugin directly via WordPress
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Follow the configuration manual

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which Tweets are displayed in the blog? =

Mathilda focuses on the core functionality of Twitter meaning only Text-Tweets, Images, Hashtags, Mentions and Links are displayed. Image Series, Surveys, Quotes, Videos and GEO-Locations are not or only partly supported. 

= Why does Mathilda not support Retweets or Quotes? =

Retweets are not your data. That is why we do not show them. The same is valid for quotes.

= Will the tweets be loaded automaticly? =

Yes. But the first load must be done manually (Tools/Tweets/Load Tweets). Otherwise the autoload will not activated.

= How often will the tweets be loaded? =

As Standard your tweets will be fetched from Twitter every 15 minutes. But you can define the period in minutes different in the plugin settings.

= What is the difference between Load and Import? =

Load takes your tweets online through the Twitter API and saves them into the WordPress Database regularly. The Import takes your tweets from the files of your Twitter Archieve and saves them into the WordPress Database. For this, you must download your archieve from Twitter before.

= What do I have to do first, run the cron or import my tweets? =

All the same. It works both. Mathilda is flexible. But the autoload will only be activated with an initial cron. In addition import is only required if you have posted more than 3200 tweets.

= How can I import my tweet history? =

Twitter API provides access to your 3200 latest tweets. If you have not written more, the import is not required. To import your tweets, you must download your tweet archive from Twitter (Profile/Settings/Your Twitter Data). Your archive contains the folder "data/js/tweets". Upload the containing files to "www.yourblog.com/wp-content/uploads/mathilda-import/". Now you can run the import (Tools/Tweets).

= How does Mathilda handle the canonical URL? =

Mathilda does not modify the existing canonical url handling in WordPress. If you want to change the canonical url you must control that with a SEO plugin.

= What have to be considered with the usage of caching plugins? =

The length of the cron period in combination with the configuration of caching determines how early a tweet will be displayed within the blog. If a tweet should be displayed as early as possible, the caching must be deactivated for the page with tweets. Another possibility is removing the affected page from the cache, if new tweets have loaded.

= Does Mathila support extended tweets? =

Mathilda does support extended tweets with version 0.7 of the plugin. Extended tweets were introduced by Twitter in mid of 2016. Extended tweets are having more as 140 characters, which is allowed in specific cases. 

= Why require some updates a reset of the plugin and reload of the data? =

The plugin is an early stage of development. It is still a long way to the first stable 1.0 version. To avoid data inconsistency and process errors some updates require a reload of the data. Sometime Mathilda will have an maturity level, which does not require such resets anymore.

= Does Mathilda support WordPress Multisite? =

No. Mathilda does not support the WordPress Multisite Feature. The plugin is working on the master-site, but is not working on all other child sites within the wordpress network.

= I have activated Link Content Embed, but no linked content will be embedded.  =

The embedded content will be retrieved and generated every 15 minutes (or with the same period as the autoload of the tweets). If you have activated embed content for the first time, it takes 15 minutes latest until the changes appear. 

= How is Mathilda handling the nofollow Attribute?  =

Backlinks to Twitter will be declared as nofollow. This affects Hashtags, Mentions and the Backlink of the Tweet itself. Links within the tweets are declared as follow.

= I always receive Timeout or Internal Server Error, when I start the Load or Import.  =

Currently the procedure, which is loading and importing tweets, is one large script. Dependent of the amount of tweets this script will run serveral minutes until all data is loaded. Some hosting environments do only allow a runtime of 40 seconds (for example). Unfortunately this is not enough to complete the loading process for the plugin. Please check with your provider, if there are possiblities to increase the limited runtime for scripts. If you have no options, try to import your tweets in small portions. On mid-term this large program will be split into threads, which enable the plugin to run on these environments too. But at the moment is not realized.
